I just reached Day 15 of 100 Days of Code with Dr. Angela Yu. With the little knowledge I have gained in programming with python since I started the lesson,
I attempted to solve the Coffee Machine challenge/Project. I have posted it out here for you to run the code and share your challenges with me. I will strive
to solve all the challenges that will be raised by the public. Please don't be too critical on me because as I said, I am still learning; I haven't even reached
the Intermediate stage yet. I would love to learn programming with anyone who wishes to mentor me.
Thank you.

I will be updating the project/ finetuning the code as I gain more experience by continually practicing with Dr. Yu and my special Tutors Mr. Joel Aquah and
Master Alex.
